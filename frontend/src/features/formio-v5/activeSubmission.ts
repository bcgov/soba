 * Per-tab persistence of the submission currently being filled, so the CHEFS storage provider can

 * survives a refresh, is independent per tab, and clears on tab close. The fill form sets it on mount
 * and clears it on unmount; the provider reads it per upload. A submission not opened yet also
 * registers, in memory only, how to open it, and an upload waits for that before naming it.
